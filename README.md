# 📊 Amazon Reviews & Sales Analysis  

Analyzed Amazon product data to explore the **non-linear relationship between ratings, review counts, and monthly sales** using Python and R.  

---

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project involves **data scraping, cleaning, and modeling** to understand how consumer feedback influences product performance on Amazon.  

- **Data Source:** American Amazon product pages (scraped using Python)  
- **Objective:** Quantify and visualize how star ratings and review volumes affect sales trends  
- **Approach:** Combined statistical analysis and visualization in R with machine learning components in Python  

---

## 🧠 Key Features  
- Web scraping with `Selenium` and `BeautifulSoup` (automated dynamic page collection)  
- Data cleaning and transformation with `pandas`  
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization in `ggplot2` (R)  
- Non-linear regression modeling to estimate sales behavior  
- Insights on rating saturation and diminishing review effects  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Languages:** Python, R  
- **Libraries:** BeautifulSoup, pandas, matplotlib, ggplot2  
- **Tools:** Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebook, RStudio  

---

## 📈 Results  
- Identified that **sales increase sharply between 3.5★ and 4.5★ ratings**, then plateau afterward  
- Found **review count** has a stronger influence on sales for **mid-rated products**  
- Visualized sales vs. rating trends with non-linear fits for interpretability

## 💡 Future Work  
- Extend analysis with sentiment extraction from reviews  
- Compare patterns across product categories  
- Apply Bayesian Network modeling for causal inference
